## Description

As part of my unviersity lessons, I was tasked with using GLUT to visualize a sphere, and to be able to modify it in the 3 different axes. As the project moved along, I was addtionally tasked to do the same for a superquadric, torus, and cylinder. So I did.

## Features

- Visualize 4 different polygons
-   A sphere
-   A superquadric
-   A torus
-   A cylinder
- Modify the different polygons via
-   Streching
-   Moving it around
-   Rotating it
- "Switch" between a triangle and rectangle mesh

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [C++ Compiler](link-to-c++-compiler): Install a C++ compiler compatible with your platform.
- [GLUT Library](link-to-glut-library): Download and install the GLUT library for your operating system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    ```

3. Build the project using the provided Makefile:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

4. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./main
    ```

Now you should have the project up and running on your local machine.
